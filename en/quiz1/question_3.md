Here is the code for the music player program.

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(300px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_K2FhJU6MJ4V0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

The `tune` variable is currently set to `1`.

Which melody will play when Button `B` is pressed?

Not quite. Button B skips the track forward and will add one to the variable value, meaning `tune` will be set to `2`, which is associated with the `punchline` melody.

- (x) `punchline`

Great! Pressing Button B will add one to the variable value, meaning `tune` will be set to `2`, which is associated with the `punchline` melody.

- ( ) `dadadum`

  --- feedback ---

Not quite. The variable value is `1` and Button B adds `1` to the variable value, meaning the melody associated with value 1 (`dadadum`) will no longer play.
