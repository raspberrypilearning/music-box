### Play melody


You are going to use the <code style="background-color: #1E90FF">forever</code> block to make use of the speaker output on the micro:bit (V2 users only).

--- collapse ---
---
title: V1 micro:bit users
---

The speaker output is only available on the V2 micro:bit. You will need to connect external headphones/speakers to play sound on the V1. You will still be able to play the sound on the simulator.

There is a [guide to connecting headphones/speakers to the V1 micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/hack-your-headphones/make){:target="_blank"}.

### Style your song

As well as playing a melody, you can add a picture to the LED display to add some more style! 

--- task ---

Open the <code style="background-color: #1e90ff">Basic</code> menu and find the <code style="background-color: #1e90ff">show icon</code> block.

<img src="images/show-icon-location.png" alt="The Basic menu with the 'show icon' block highlighted." width="350"/>

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Drag the <code style="background-color: #1e90ff">show icon</code> block into the code editor. 

Place it inside the <code style="background-color: #1e90ff">forever</code> block **above** your <code style="background-color: #e63022">melody</code> block. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

MakeCode has pre-programmed icons that display on the LED panel. 

The default is a **heart** icon. 

**Click** on the heart to see the other options. 

**Choose** an icon that represents your melody. 

<img src="images/choose-icon.gif" alt="The show icon block is expanded to show the multiple options for icons. After a bit of scrolling the duck is selected from the list." width="400"/>

We have chosen this little duck! 

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(250px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:relative;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_7LdLvFhbzYuD" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

--- task ---

When you make a change to a code block in the code editor panel, the simulator will restart.

**Test your program** 

+ You should now hear the melody playing until it is done (and then looping because of the forever loop)
+ You should also see the icon you picked displayed on the LEDs

--- /task ---    

Well done, you have created your first music program on a micro:bit!
